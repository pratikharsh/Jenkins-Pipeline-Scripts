## Overview
This repository is a treasure trove of automation goodness! The Jenkins pipeline script here is crafted with care to make your AWS EC2 instance management a breeze. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this script will save you time and effort.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the automation magic, make sure you've got the following in place:

- **Jenkins:** Ensure you have Jenkins installed and configured on your server.
- **AWS CLI:** The AWS Command Line Interface should be set up on your Jenkins server.
- **Credentials:** Add your AWS access key and secret access key to Jenkins credentials as 'aws_credentials'.
- **Instance Details:** Have the EC2 instance ID and AWS region handy for configuration.
## Pipeline Structure
The pipeline script is organized using the Declarative Pipeline syntax, making it a joy to read and maintain. It's a sleek structure with stages that guide you through the process of starting your EC2 instance.

## Instructions
Getting started with the magic is a breeze:

1. **Configure AWS Credentials in Jenkins:**
    - Add your AWS credentials to Jenkins using the ID 'aws_credentials'.
2. **Edit Pipeline Environment:**
    - Customize the `**INSTANCE_ID**`  and `**AWS_REGION**`  variables in the script.
3. **Run Pipeline:**
    - Trigger the pipeline manually or set up automatic triggers for hands-free execution.
4. **View Execution:**
    - Keep an eye on the Jenkins dashboard to witness the magic in action!
## Notes
A few things to keep in mind:

- **Permissions:** Ensure Jenkins has the necessary permissions to manage EC2 instances in your AWS region.
- **AWS CLI Configuration:** Make sure the AWS CLI on your Jenkins server is correctly set up.
